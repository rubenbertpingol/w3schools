<h2>Building a Career</h2>
<p>Today, and more than ever, most people are responsible for building their own 
careers.</p>
<p>Whether you are just starting, or you have several years of experience, these 
paragraphs might help you advance your career. </p>
<p class="intro">The 9 most important career planning tips is listed below:</p>

<hr />

<h2>1. Never Stop Learning</h2>
<p><b>Life-long learning is your keyword.</b></p>
<p>The world is constantly changing, and 
everybody is looking for new ways of doing business.</p>
<p>If you have decided that your current skills are good enough,
you have also decided that your current job is good enough. </p>
<p>But if you want a career in the future, you should add regular updates to your 
skills and knowledge.</p>
<hr />

<h2>2. Ask, Listen And Learn</h2>
<p><b>A good listener can learn a lot.</b></p>
<p>Listen to your co-workers, your boss, and your superiors. You can learn a lot 
from their experience. </p>
<p>Ask about issues that interest you, and listen to what they say. Let them 
tell you about how things work, and what you could have done better.</p>
<p>Most people will love to be your free tutor.</p>

<hr />
<h2>3. Fulfill Your Current Job</h2>
<p><b>Your current job might be best place to start your career.</b></p>
<p>It is often very little that 
separates successful people from the average. But nothing comes free.</p>
<p>If you do your job well and fulfill your responsibilities, this is often the 
best way to start a new career.</p>
<p>Talk to your supervisor about things you can do. Suggest improvements. Offer 
your help when help is needed. In return ask for help to build a better career. 
It is often possible - right inside your own organization - especially if you 
have proved to be a valued employee.</p>
<hr />

<h2>4. Build Your Network</h2>
<p><b>Your next career step might arise from your contact network.</b></p>
<p>Did you know that more than 50% of all jobs are obtained from contact 
networks?</p>
<p>If you have a good contact network, it&nbsp; is also a good place to discover 
future careers, to explore new trends, and to learn about new&nbsp; 
opportunities.</p>
<p>Spend some time building new contacts, and don't forget to maintain the ones 
you already have.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to get serious information from your network is to 
regularly ask your contacts how they are, what they do, and what is new about 
their careers.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5. Identify Your Current Job</h2>
<p><b>Your current job should be identified, not assumed. </b></p>
<p>Make sure you don't work with tasks you assume are important. This is waste 
of time and talent. </p>
<p>When you start in a new job, talk to your superior about your priorities. If 
you're not sure about what is most important, then ask him. And ask him again. 
Often you will be surprised about the differences between what you assume, and 
what is really important.</p>

<hr />
<h2>6. Identify Your Next Job</h2>
<p><b>Your dream job must be identified.</b></p>
<p>Before you start planning your future career, be sure you have identified 
your dream job.</p>
<p>In your dream job, you will be doing all the things you enjoy, and none of 
the things you don't enjoy. What kind of job would that be?</p>
<p>Do you like or dislike having responsibility for other employees. Do you like 
to work with technology or with people? Do you want to run your own business? Do 
you want to be an artist, a designer or a skilled engineer? A manager?</p>
<p>Before building your future career your goal must be identified. </p>

<hr />
<h2>7. Prepare Yourself</h2>
<p><b>Your dream might show up tomorrow. Be prepared.</b></p>
<p>Don't wait a second. Update your CV now, and continue to update it regularly.</p>
<p>Tomorrow your dream job may show up right before your nose. Prepare for it 
with a professional CV and be ready to describe yourself as a valuable object to 
anyone that will try to recruit you.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to write a CV, or how to describe yourself, start 
learning it now.</p>

<hr />
<h2>8. Pick The Right Tools</h2>
<p><b>Pick the tools you can handle.</b></p>
<p>You can build your future career using a lot of different tools. Studying at 
W3Schools is easy. Taking a full master degree is more complicated.</p>
<p>You can add a lot to your career by studying books and tutorials (like the 
one you find at W3Schools). Doing short time courses with certification tests 
might add valuable weight to your CV. And don't forget: Your current job is 
often the most valuable source of building new skills.</p>
<p>Don't pick a tool that is too heavy for you to handle!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<hr />
<h2>9. Realize Your Dreams</h2>
<p><b>Put your dreams into action.</b></p>
<p>Don't let a busy job kill your dreams. If you have higher goals, put them 
into action now. </p>
<p>If you have plans about taking more education, getting a better job, starting 
your own company or something else, you should not use your daily job as a 
&quot;waiting station&quot;. Your daily job will get more and more busy, you will be 
caught up in the rat race, and you will burn up your energy.</p>
<p>If you have this energy, you should use it now, to realize your dreams.</p>
