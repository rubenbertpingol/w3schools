Here comes a long quotation:
<blockquote>
This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation. This is a long quotation.
</blockquote>
Notice that a browser inserts white space before and after a blockquote element. It also inserts margins for the blockquote element.
